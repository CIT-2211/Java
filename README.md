Greetings, esteemed stranger! It is a genuine pleasure to make your acquaintance. 
In the tapestry of professional interactions, such moments of connection often carry the potential for meaningful exchanges, and I am delighted to engage with you. 
May our dialogue be as enriching as it is courteous.
All the solitary flames burning in the dead of night shall ultimately converge into a boundless radiance at dawn's first light.  
The finest moment to plant a tree was a decade ago; the next best is now.  
The world's gaze forms their prison, not your chains. A noble eagle never concerns itself with how sparrows judge the height of its flight.  
Should these words resonate with you, dear friend, I invite you to share your reflections. Let time unfold through the years, carrying your insights and "them" alike, as we witness the transformations of the coming decade.
